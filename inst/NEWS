CHANGES IN VERSION 0.99.0
-------------------------

SIGNIFICANT USER-VISIBLE CHANGES

    o The flowQB package used to contain about 35 MB 
      of data included with it. We need to share
      additional examples as we extended the support
      from LED only to other kinds of beads. This
      increases the size significantly and it is
      therefore no longer reasonable to keep the data
      directly in the flowQB package. Therefore, we
      have started the flowQBData experimental data
      package to host all the required data files.

NEW FEATURES

    o None, all old features removed for now.
